## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Overview

**Workflow Flow:**

```

\[Gmail Trigger] --> \[Set Node: Extract Email] --> \[OpenAI Node: Categorize Ticket]
\--> \[Switch Node: Route by Category] --> \[Slack Node / ClickUp / Trello]
\--> \[Optional: Auto-Reply Email]

````

1. **Gmail Trigger:** Detects new support emails.  
2. **Set Node:** Cleans and structures email data.  
3. **OpenAI Node:** Categorizes ticket automatically.  
4. **Switch Node:** Routes tickets to the correct channel based on category.  
5. **Slack Node / ClickUp / Trello:** Sends notification or creates a task.  
6. **Optional Email Node:** Sends acknowledgment to the customer.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

1. **Install n8n**  
   ```bash
   npm install n8n -g
   n8n start
````

2. **Connect Gmail Node**

   * OAuth2 setup
   * Trigger on a specific label/folder (e.g., `support@yourcompany.com`)
3. **Connect OpenAI Node**

   * Use your API key
   * Prompt for ticket classification:

     ```
     Classify this support ticket into one of the following categories: Refund, Billing, Technical Issue, General Inquiry. 
     Return only the category.
     Ticket: {{$json["ticket_body"]}}
     ```
4. **Configure Switch Node**

   * Branch by category to Slack/ClickUp/Trello nodes
5. **Connect Slack Node**

   * OAuth setup
   * Channels per category: `#refunds`, `#billing-support`, `#tech-support`, `#general-support`
6. **Optional: Email Auto-Reply**

   * Gmail Node ‚Üí polite acknowledgment using structured email template

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

* Use the sample emails in `/examples/` folder.
* Example: `test_email_refund.eml`
* Send the test email ‚Üí check Slack notification ‚Üí verify correct routing.

---

## üì∏ Demo Ideas for README

1. **GIF:** Send a test email ‚Üí Slack notification appears in the correct channel.
2. **GIF:** OpenAI Node categorization in real-time showing category output.
3. **Screenshot:** Workflow diagram in n8n with nodes highlighted and labeled.

- Tools: Lucidchart, Figma, or even draw.io.

---

## **5. Demo GIF / Screenshot Ideas**
1. **Send a test ‚ÄúRefund‚Äù email** ‚Üí Slack channel receives the ticket notification.  
2. **OpenAI Node output** ‚Üí showing JSON category result.  
3. **n8n workflow screen capture** ‚Üí hover over each node with labels for visual clarity.
